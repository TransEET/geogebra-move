## Embodied mathematics

GeoGebra Plus adds body landmark (pose) recognition to the GeoGebra interface, allowing users to interact with the mathematical objects on the GeoGebra canvas in an embodied way.

## Usage

To use the app, visit https://transeet.eu/ggbdance03.

You will be met with a blank GeoGebra canvas and some green button at the top of the page.
You will need to allow your browser access to the webcam when asked.

After clicking on the button "Start body tracking", you should see a stickfigure representation of your body (avatar) on the screen matching your movements.

You can either play around with creating your own objects and interacting with them or try some of the already created applets.
